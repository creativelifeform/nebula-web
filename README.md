# Nebula Web

This is the website for [Nebula](https://getnebula.app), a 3D particle system designer for desktops and the web.

This app has been built with [nextjs](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/)

## Installation

```
git clone git@github.com:creativelifeform/nebula-web.git
npm i
```

### Environment

You'll need to set up a couple of environment variables, examples can be found in the `.env.example` file

## Video

The workflow for video creation that I've found works best is

1. Create your video in iMovie
2. For YouTube you can upload direct to YouTube from iMovie
3. For the hero video, save as a raw MP4 with the highest possible quality
4. Use [Handbrake](https://handbrake.fr) to compress/encode the video
5. TODO: Find best way to create a gif from an iMovie video
